**Title:** Heart Attack in Youth vs Adults in Germany

**Aim:**
To study and predict heart attack cases in young people and adults in Germany using machine learning and health data.

**Objective:**

1. To compare heart attack cases between young people and adults.
2. To find important factors that increase the risk of heart attacks.
3. To create models to predict heart attacks.
4. To provide useful ideas for better healthcare.

**Abstract:**
Heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide. Understanding its occurrence in different age groups is important for taking action. This study looks at heart attacks in young people and adults in Germany using a dataset of health and lifestyle factors. Machine learning methods like Logistic Regression and Random Forest are used to predict heart attacks. The goal is to help doctors find high-risk people and suggest preventive actions.

**Introduction:**
Heart attacks, also called myocardial infarctions, usually happen to older people, but now more young people are getting them. Factors like obesity, lifestyle choices, and family history affect heart health. Studying heart attack differences between young and older people in Germany can provide helpful information for better healthcare planning. This study uses machine learning to analyze data on age, lifestyle, and health conditions to find patterns and key risk factors.

**Future Scope:**

1. Adding more data from different groups of people and lifestyles.
2. Using real-time health data for better predictions.
3. Creating personalized health advice systems.
4. Working with doctors to improve prevention.
5. Using advanced AI methods to make better models.

**Conclusion:**
This study shows the differences in heart attack risks between young and older people in Germany. The models can help with early detection and prevention. Future work can focus on improving models and using real-time health data for better results.
